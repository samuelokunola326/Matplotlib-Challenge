# Tumor Drug Analysis
In this Challenge I am using matplotlip to plot lab results of tumor treatments on rats and drawing conclusions from it.




## Results of Treatment

###### Treatment over Test Period

Over the course of 45 days 10 different drugs were tested on mice and every 5 days the number of surviving mice were measured. As a result the top two drugs that saw the highest number of surviving mice were Capomulin and Ramicane withover 80% of the mice surviving throughout the entire treament period.

###### Top 2 Drugs vs Bottom 2 Drug

The average tumor volume was measured on the last day of the testing period to test the drug ability to reduce the size of tumors and this chart shows the average size for the best two drugs versus the worst two. 

Another interesting insight you can this graph you can see that although Capomulin had the most surviving mice, Ramicane was actually the most effective at reducing the size of the tumor. Comparing the bottom 2 drugs you can see that although propriva lost the most mice during treatment it was slightly better than infubinol at reducing the size of the tumors.
